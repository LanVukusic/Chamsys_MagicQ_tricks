# Chamsys_MagicQ_tricks
A list of quick tricks that get you to speed when programming with Chamsys MagicQ.
I wished to create a bigger index of shortcuts. [There is an official link](https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/ch47.html)
for the magicQ shortcuts provided by chamsys.  
This list expands on it.





### Shift + Record / Include / Copy / Remove
Opens a record window with aditional settings, where you can select which atributes are selected / recorded... 
(lets say, just dimmer and not the positions).
> Aditionally: setup->Windows you can set Rec Options as "Always show..."

***

### Merge / Remove record options
When you "Shift + Remove", upon you select destination, you geta menu with "Merge" and "Remove" options in top left.  
That gives you the option to either:
* remove the atributes in programmer from selected playback.
* merge the programer with the playback (previous stuff saved + the new ones).

***

### Set the PAUSE and GO button to trigger playbacks
> Setup -> Playback -> Play/Pause use exec grid 1.  

You can set up exec grid 1 as a 10x2 grid, and record your playbacks on it. Than you will be able to trigger them from the playbacks

***

### Pos/ Beam/ Color... + Inc
for example hold down the POS button and press include then only position data 
will be brought into the programmer when you select a cue etc;

***

### Size/speed masters
Just by selecting the group then recording to a fader and then simply choosing what attributes it controls.

*** 

### Updating palette offsets
Updating the palette offset, saving serious amounts of time when updating positions!

***

### Automatic icons
When you patch a generic dimmer and name it "Haze", magicQ automatically sets the icon to a hazer.

***

### Shift + Single = Pair (selection in Highlight mode)
That takes first and last in a group and work inwards  
On Mq500 there is a dedicated button for it

***

### Crossfader remaping
You can remap all the crossfader buttons to your own taste in:
> Setup -> Playback
You can cset up the GO button to tap to time (Global or selected) for example.  

*** 

### <S\> + Record
!! TO DO 

***

### Thru + Record = Snapshot
It records the whole DMX output of the console.

***

### Ctrl + Record  
Records the DMX input.  
For example: It enables you to copy positions from one desk to another.

***

### Shift + Highlight
allows you to set custom selections like with Parts and Segments.
